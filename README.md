(i) Depth data from true depth sensor

We get the RGBD data from Apple IOS true depth sensor. Now, have to look for key point detection in the depth maps and make the measurements for our required positions.





(ii) 2D data and 3D data to get the critical points 







(iii) 2D data to form 3d reconstruction from monocular and stereo setup cameras
